# bookmarkOS
A wrapper for bookmarkOS. This application will allow you to share urls directly from your android browsers right into BookmarkOS.

This allows for a tight integration with the BookmarkOS site and gives you the freedom to bookmark urls without the hassle of manually copying and pasting them.
